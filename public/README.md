Place your CV PDF here so the site can download it.

Steps:

1. Copy your CV PDF into this folder with the filename `Resume-Khoa-Ho.pdf`.

   Example:

   ```bash
   cp /path/to/YourCV.pdf public/Resume-Khoa-Ho.pdf
   ```

2. The "Download CV" button will download the file as `Khoa_Ho_CV.pdf` in users' browsers.

If you want me to add a placeholder PDF file now, tell me and I'll add a small placeholder PDF (recommended: replace it with your real CV later).
